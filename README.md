# Predictive Modelling for British_Airways

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer bookings for flights or holidays using data manipulation, machine learning algorithms, and interpretive analysis. By leveraging predictive models and evaluating their performance, we can proactively acquire customers before they embark on their holiday, resulting in increased sales and customer engagement.

## Background
Customers today have access to vast amounts of information, making the buying cycle different from what it used to be. Being reactive and waiting for customers to make purchases at the airport is no longer effective. Airlines must take a proactive approach to acquire customers early in the process. Data and predictive models play a crucial role in achieving this goal.

## Project Objectives
- Explore and prepare the dataset
- Train a machine learning model
- Evaluate the model and present findings

## Dataset Exploration and Preparation
To begin, we conducted an in-depth exploration of the provided customer booking dataset. This exploration helped us understand the dataset's columns and gather basic statistics. Armed with this knowledge, we prepared the dataset for the predictive model. Additionally, we devised strategies to create new features that would enhance the model's performance.

## Machine Learning Model Training
Once the dataset was adequately prepared, we proceeded to train a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a customer will make a booking. To achieve this, we employed an algorithm that facilitates the analysis of each variable's contribution to the model's predictive power. We found that a RandomForest algorithm was well-suited for this purpose.

## Model Evaluation and Findings
After training the machine learning model, we conducted cross-validation to evaluate its performance. We generated appropriate evaluation metrics to measure its accuracy and effectiveness. Furthermore, we created visualizations to interpret the contribution of each variable to the model. These visualizations provided valuable insights into the predictive power of the dataset.

Based on our analysis, we summarized our findings in a single slide. The slide captured the key insights derived from the evaluation and visualizations, showcasing the potential of the model to predict customer bookings effectively.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we successfully explored and prepared the customer booking dataset, trained a predictive machine learning model, and evaluated its performance. By leveraging data and predictive models, we enabled a proactive approach to customer acquisition, ensuring increased sales and customer engagement. This project serves as a testament to the power of data-driven decision-making and its impact on business success.
